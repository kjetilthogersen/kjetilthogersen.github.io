title: Introducing pyGlacier
date: 2021-06-30 10:00:00 +0100
abstract: 'Glaciers move with a large variety of speeds. From ice creep at velocities of a few meters per year up to several kilometers per year. Some glaciers shift between slow and fast modes at intervals up to several decades. In a recent paper, we model this phenomenon using a flowline glacier model we have developed: pyGlacier. In this post, I will give a brief introduction to the mathematical formulation and how to use it for your own simulations.'
