I have a background in computational physics, and my research has largely been focused on the physics of interfaces, with emphasis on instabilities. This includes both theoretical and numerical development. I have also worked on numerical modeling of glaciers, with particular focus on the ice bedrock interface. Our goal is to understand how the coupling between subglacial hydrology and friction affects glacier velocity variations.

I'm involved in a number of projects at the Department of Physics and Geoscience at the University of Oslo.

#### History-dependent friction (NFR):
- Statistical approach: Effective properties of multi-contact interfaces from the single contact behavior.
- Design surfaces with specific frictional properties using machine learning.

#### Minimal models of earthquakes rupture:
- Minimal models to understand basic phenomena in earthquake rupture.
- Our current focus is on the understanding of slip pulses (localized slip) in earthquake rupture.

#### Glacier instabilities:
- Theoretical development of processes at glacier beds.
- Using machine learning to understand unstable glacier dynamics in Svalbard.
- Numerical development and simulations of unstable glacier dynamics.

#### MAMMAMIA - Multi-scAle-Multi-Method Analysis of Mechanisms causing Ice Acceleration (NFR):
- Theoretical development and numerical modeling of glacier flow, compared to extensive field and satellite data.

#### Multiphase flow:
- Development of finite element model for multiphase flow with unstructured adaptive meshing.
- Statistical properties of particle suspensions with finite element simulations.
- Mixing at low Reynolds numbers.
